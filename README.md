#### ğŸ”¶ My name is Guido Ortiz, and I am a Full Stack Developer. ğŸ’»
 ğŸ”¶ In 2021, I enter Henry Bootcamp. ğŸ’¥
 ğŸ”¶ With +800 hours of programming based on practices and real projects, I learned some of the most demanded skills in the market: HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Redux, Express, SQL, Sequelize. ğŸ˜œ
 ğŸ”¶ My individual project was Foods App, a SPA using React for the Front End and Redux as stage management. The components were developed with pure CSS, without the use of external libraries. It consumes data from an Spoonacular API through a Back End developed in NodeJS using Express. ğŸ’¥
